# HashMap Hash Collision Linked List Implementation
A java implementation of HashMap hash collision resolution with LinkedLists. Since some of the words in the list of words have the same first letter, or character, there are hash collisions when a second word that starts with the same letter is inserted into the same bucket. The linked list implementation resolves these hashing collisions.
